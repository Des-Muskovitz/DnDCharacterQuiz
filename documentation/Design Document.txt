Create Personality test, See pokemon mystery dungeon

Testing for Race, Class, and Alignment
(PHB Races, only use SRD)

Give each catagory 4 questions, randomly spread through the webpage.

Each question will fade in and fade out.

Start the webpage on a screen with a text entry field for a name, and a button that says start quiz

Have a total of 12 questions for each catagory, (create question JS class?)

Each question has 4 choices, each giving 1-2 points for 1-2 options, most points at end wins
if two have equal points at the end of 12 questions, add one more question from each catagory or coin flip

Set ID of question to be equal to catagory, and set return value of form to be 1-4 depending on which radio button is pressed
question class will store each answer and assosiated points as an array of strings (ex [class] WI1 = Wizard 1 point, WA2 = Warlock 2 point)

Have 3 images for each combo of race and class, change the background color depending on alignment

give brief discription of each catagory, talk about race, talk about class, talk about alignment
(add links to DND beyond about race and class??????????)

Add button at the bottom to retake the quiz, everything fades out, and resets

Single HTML page
Two JS pages, JQuery???
